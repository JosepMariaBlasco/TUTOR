## Quick installation

Download [Tutor.zip](Tutor.zip), unzip it in some directory of your choice,
and run `setenv` to set the path
(for Linux users: use `. ./setenv.sh`, not `./setenv.sh`, or your path will not be set).

If you intend to use RXU, the Rexx Preprocessor for Unicode, you will need to
download and install the Rexx Parser
(available at <https://rexx.epbcn.com/rexx.parser/> and <https://github.com/JosepMariaBlasco/rexx.parser/>)
and also run `setenv` in the parser installation directory.

You can then navigate to the `samples` directory and try the samples by using `[rexx] rxu filename`, or experiment interactively with the `rxutry` utility.

## Release notes for version 0.6a, 20250215

Version 0.6a includes some small changes to allow running RXU,
the Rexx Preprocessor for Unicode, under Jean Louis Faucher's ooRexxShell
(thanks to Jean Louis for suggesting the changes).

## Components of TUTOR which can be used independently

* [The UTF8](utf8.cls) routine can be used independently of TUTOR. UTF8 detects whether Unicode.cls has been loaded (by looking for the existence of a .Bytes class that subclasses .String), and returns .Bytes strings or standard ooRexx strings as appropriate.
